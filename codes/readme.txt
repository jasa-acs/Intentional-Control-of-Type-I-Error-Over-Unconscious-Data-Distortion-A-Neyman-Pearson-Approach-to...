README

This file briefly describes the material supplemental to the paper, which is contained in the "Supplementary Data and Codes" folder.
1.  "NP_data_distortion_appendix.pdf" is the appendix to the main text, containing proofs of the theoretical results and additional results.
2. The folder "data" includes four subfolders described as follows.
- "Input" contains all the data in R data format that are used to generate the empirical results in the paper.
- "Numerical Outputs" includes all the empirical results that can be used directly to produce the tables and figures in the paper.
- "RawSamples" includes the raw social media posts before pre-processing as well as the labels.  
- "Preprocessing" includes all the files generated by the pre-processing steps.
 
3. The folder "code" contains all the R codes used to generate each individual table or figure in the paper. The sub-folder "code\preprocess" contains all Python and bash scripts used for pre-processing the raw samples, organized in an R Markdown file (process_data.rmd). 
4. To generate the empirical results of the paper, one only needs to run the R codes under "code" using the data in the "data/Input" folder. They are self-contained for the convenience of readers who wish to reproduce each individual table or figure published in the paper.
5. To replicate the transformation of the raw data into useable frequency matrices, one can run the process_data.rmd under the "\code\preprocess" after storing the raw data under the same direcotry.
6. To replicate the entire process of this research project including preprocessing the raw data and reproducing the results in the paper, combine (5) and (6).
7. For readers who want to skip the data pre-processing steps, they can use the R codes in the folder "code" to import the "matrix.txt" dataset under the "data\Preprocessing" folder and then reproduce the results.
